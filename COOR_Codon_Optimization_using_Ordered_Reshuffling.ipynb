        "In the era of protein design and synthesis, it is important to optimize codons to achieve desired protein expression—if not optimal, at least sufficient expression in an organism of interest. Nuclear-encoded ribosomal and proteasome proteins are highly translated (PMID: 22068332). At the same time, some proteins may be poorly translated, or in some cases, a few coding sequences (CDS) of pseudogenes may never get translated. Therefore, it is safe to assume that not all coding sequences are constrained to evolve for higher translation efficiency.\n",

        "This tool takes a DNA coding sequence from a known protein (Protein 1), translates it into amino acids, and records which codons were used for each amino acid in the order they appear. It creates a codon database where each amino acid is linked to its list of codons in the order from the original gene. Then, when you input a new amino acid sequence (Protein 2 - for the gene to be codon optimized), the tool builds a matching DNA sequence by reusing codons from the database following the same order as the Protein 1. If an amino acid occurs more times than codons available, it loops back to the start of the list. The final output is a DNA sequence that mirrors the codon usage pattern of the original gene.\n",
